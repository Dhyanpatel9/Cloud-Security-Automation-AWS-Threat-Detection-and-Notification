## Overview
This project implements an automated **AWS Threat Detection and Alerting System** using **AWS GuardDuty**, **EventBridge**, **Lambda**, and **AmazonSNS**. It provides real-time monitoring of security threats and sends notifications to the security team whenever high-severity findings are detected. The infrastructure is provisioned and managed with **Terraform** for easy deployment and scalability.
